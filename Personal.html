        I'm a single father of two amazing boys. Family is very important to me and the love of my
        kids motivates me to excel to heights in life I'd otherwise fail to achieve.
        Parenting and work takes up most of my time.
        But when I do get out of the house I enjoy camping, hiking, and fishing in the warm months.
        Playing and watching hockey in the cold months.

        I've always had a passion for solving puzzles. Whether they're on paper or mechanical
        my collection of various puzzling contraptions is constantly growing. My love of puzzles is what
        drew me to coding. I love being presented with a problem to solve. It also led to my more niche
        hobby, locksport. The challenge of picking locks of various designs and difficulties.
        Although lockpicking may have a nefarious reputation, lockpicking is better viewed as a
        mechanical puzzle solving than anyhting sinister. Once you understand the varitey of designs
        and tools used in the craft, it's easy to see why it attracts puzzle enthusiasts worlwide.

        I also love music. I mostly enjoy listening to music, but I do play guitar, piano, and harmonica.
        All three of those at varying levels of skill, none of them exceeding the amatuer level. But it's
        fun and that's what counts most.

        Cooking is another passion of mine. I've been focusing on learning
        Chinese, Thia, and Vietnamenase cuisine recently. I also recently began getting my thumb a little green
        growing my own fresh herbs and vegetables.
